# Legacy Git Scripts

This folder contains legacy Git scripts that were previously used for Git automation. These scripts are kept for reference but are no longer actively used.

The main Git automation is now handled by the scripts in the parent directory:

- `automate.js`: Main automation script
- `git-manager.js`: Git operations manager
- `issue-manager.js`: GitHub issue manager
- `config.json`: Configuration file

Please use the batch files in the root directory for Git operations:

- `git-init.bat`: Initialize the repository
- `git-commit.bat`: Commit and push changes
- `git-work.bat`: Start working on an issue
- `git-complete.bat`: Complete an issue
